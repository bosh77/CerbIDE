CerbIDE - IDE for Cerberus X

CerbIDE is an IDE for programming with Cerberus X. This is the first version, still to be tested, currently only available for Windows, and with minimal features. It is likely to contain some bugs.

The IDE has the usual text editor functions, so cut, copy and paste, and others... In addition, there are the Split functions, to divide the sheets into 2 separate windows. 
With CTRL + K you can select the main project, very useful for not having to return to the project every time you run the app. 
The Shortcuts window contains the list of bookmarks, classes, etc. To create a bookmark, simply write "note:" after the apostrophe, or even just an "@", for example: '@this is a bookmark.' 
The next features that will be added:
- Syntax Highlighting
- Go To Definition
- Intellisense
- MAC OS and Linux version
